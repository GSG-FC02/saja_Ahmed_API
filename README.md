build an app that queries an API and uses the results to update the DOM.
What you choose to build and how you choose to display the data is entirely up to you!

## Pajes :

## indx page :
It contains an entry and a search button
Contains the main Div, including Div for image and Div for text.

## style page :
The style gives the index page a beautiful look that makes it easy to use, read and manipulate the page.

## script page :
JavaScript works to implement a specific activity according to certain conditions
From which it is possible to create HTML elements
And through which it can give the items a certain style
Through it, elements can be attached to the console
